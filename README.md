## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

[MDN WEB DOCS - Alignment and auto margins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Alignment/Box_Alignment_in_Flexbox#alignment_and_auto_margins) - This helped me in the desktop layout where I needed to align the _reset button_ vertically to the bottom of the flex container.
